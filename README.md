# BowlingGame

Basic rules of bowling:

A game consists of ten frames.
Each frame, the player has two opportunities to roll the ball and knock down as many pins as possible.
Knocking down all the pins on the first throw is called a strike. This gives bonus to add points of next two rolls in the current frame score.
Knocking down all the pins in two throws is called a spare.This gives bonus to add points of next roll in the current frame score.
The score corresponds to the number of pins knocked down and the bonus.
